# 📚 Manaday's PKM using Obsidian

This is the Obsidian vault that I use for my personal knowledge management (PKM). After trying several note-taking tools like Evernote, OneNote, and Notion over the years I have settled down with Obsidian due to its simple and non-proprietary idea of using a `markdown` file format to store notes.

I use limited Obsidian plugins to read my notes even without Obsidian in the future. Although, there are some amazing plugins that simplify the complex task of knowledge linking like **DataView**.

I created this repo from my actual Obsidian vault that I use regularly. I have kept lots of non-personal notes in the root folder `myzettel` as is to give you a more realistic picture of the overall folder structure and my usage of Obsidian. You may want to remove those notes from the root directory if they're irrelevant / not useful to you. Feel free to download/clone and tweak the templates as per your taste.

If you have any questions or suggestions use the **Issues** section. I answer them whenever I can.

I hope this repo helps in improving your Obsidian PKM. 😇

Sharing is caring! 🤝
