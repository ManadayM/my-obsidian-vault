# Type Inference
When a language compiler tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to.

In [[TypeScript]] it happens when you declare and initialize the variable simultaneously.

**If you just declare a variable but don't assign any value to it then that variable will be considered of type `any`.**

## Effective Type Inference (TypeScript)
```typescript
// Declaration + Initialization
// TypeScript will infer its type as Date.
const today = new Date();
```

## Generic Type Inference (TypeScript)
```typescript
// Only declaration without annotation
// Here, type inference won't happen.
let today;
today = new Date();
```

## Type Inference and functions
With `functions`, Type Inference will figure out what type of value a function will return. It cannot happen for the function arguments.

**It is recommended to always annotate a function with its return type.** If you don't return from a function by mistake then the TypeScript compiler will infer its return type as `void` which is not desirable.

```typescript
// Return type will be void which is not desirable
const subtract = (a: number, b: number) => {
	a - b; // notice the missing 'return' keyword
}
```
