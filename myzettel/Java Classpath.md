# Java Classpath
- The `PATH` and `CLASSPATH` are the two most important **environment variables** of the Java environment which are used to find the JDK binaries.
- The most common cause of dreaded error like `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError` and `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException` is either incorrect or misconfigured `CLASSPATH` in Java.
- `PATH` is an environment variable that is used to locate [[Java Development Kit(JDK)|JDK]] binaries like the `java` or `javac`.
- `CLASSPATH`, an environment variable is used by System or Application [[ClassLoader]] to locate and load compile Java bytecodes stored in the `.class` file.
- In order to set `PATH` in Java, you need to include the `JDK_HOME/bin` directory in the `PATH` environment variable.
- In order to set `CLASSPATH` in Java, you need to include all those directories where you have put either your `.class` file or JAR file which is required by your Java application.
- `PATH` can not be overridden by any Java settings
- `CLASSPATH` can be overridden by providing the command-line option `-classpath` or `-cp` to both `java` and `javac` commands or by using the `Class-Path` attribute in the `Manifest` file inside the JAR archive.
- The `PATH` environment variable is used by the operating system to find any binary or command typed in the shell, this is true for both Windows and Linux environments while `CLASSPATH` is only used by Java ClassLoaders to load class files.
