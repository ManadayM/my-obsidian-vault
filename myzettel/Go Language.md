# Go Language
- Strong, static type system.
- C inspired syntax *
- Multi-paradigm programming language i.e. Procedural and Object-oriented. It is up to the implementor to decide which style suits and fits the problem on hand.
- Garbage collected.
- Fully compiled language.
- Focus on Rapid Compilation.
- Single binary output *
- **Cross Platform**. Build for any OS and Architecture from any device. For example, setting `GOOS = windows` and `GOARCH = amd64` will produce executable code for that specific OS and architecture from any host environment.

## Philosophy & Values
- **Simplicity**
- **Out-of-the-box tooling** experience
	- **Standard libs**: Networking APIs, file manipulation, data compression, testing
	- **Go CLI**: Project initialization, build, code generation, test command, profiling, doc generation.
- **Backward compatibility** promise unless the language issue belongs to *Security*, *Spec errors*, *Bugs*, or *Unspecified behavior*.

## Primary Use Cases
- Web Services - **Most common use case.**
- Web Applications - **Most common use case.**
- DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes) - **Most common use case.**
- GUI / Thick-client applications
- Machine learning

## Who uses it?
- IBM
- Amazon
- Facebook
- Cloudflare
- Google
- Docker
- Netflix
- Digital Ocean
- Twilio SendGrid

## Motivation
The creators of the Go language focused on the 3 broad areas as follows.

- Efficient Compilation - Java, JavaScript, Python.
- Efficient Execution - C++, Java.
- Ease of Programming - JavaScript, Python.

Since none of these programming languages covered all these 3 areas for Google engineers a new language was required. It paved the way for the Go language.

## Timeline
- [2007] - Start of design.
- [2009] - Publicly announced.
- [2012] - Release 1.0

## Creators of Go
The creators of Go were working at Google. However, Go is not a Google project.
- Ken Thompson - Associated with B and C languages, Unix, and UTF-8.
- Rob Pike - Associated with Unix and UTF-8.
- Robert Griesemer - Hotspot JVM.
