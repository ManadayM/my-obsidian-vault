# Event Bus
- Event Bus in a [[Microservice|microservice architecture]] is similar to Bus Topology in [[Networking]]. 
- The Event Bus mechanism allows different components to communicate with each other without knowing about each other.
- A component can send an event to Event Bus without knowing the end consumers.
- Components can listen to Events on an Event Bus, without knowing who sent the Events.
- Many different implementations - RabbitMQ, Kafka, NATS, etc.
