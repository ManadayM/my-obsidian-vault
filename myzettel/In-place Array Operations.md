# [In-place Array Operations](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/511/in-place-operations/3257/)

"In-place array operations" is a technique to perform array operations without creating a copy of the array in question. This way, instead of requiringÂ `O(N)`Â space, we can reduce it down toÂ `O(1)`.

An important difference between in-place and not in-place is that in-placeÂ _modifies the input Array_. This means that other functionsÂ *can no longer access the original data* because it has been overwritten.

## When not to use it?
Do not use [[In-place Array Operations|in-place array operations]] in the following circumstances.
1. If we will need the original values again later. In such a case, it's best to create a copy to work with or anything else but in-place operation.
2. If somebody else has written the code and tread carefully. If another code is depending on the original array then an in-place operation will completely break the program.
