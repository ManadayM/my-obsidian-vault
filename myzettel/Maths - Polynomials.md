# [Maths - Polynomials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffLLmV4mZwU)
A polynomial is a combination of many [[Maths - Terms|terms]] linked together using addition or subtraction. It can contain any number of terms.

## Specific names
| Term count         | Name      |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| One term           | Monomial  |
| Two terms          | Binomial  |
| Three terms        | Trinomial |
| Beyond three terms | Polynomial          |

## Polynomial Example
1. 3x<sup>2</sup> + x - 5

**How many terms?** The answer is `3`. 

The equation skips some values as they don't make any difference. The above polynomial equation can be visualized as 3x<sup>2</sup> + 1x<sup>1</sup> - 5x<sup>0</sup>.

x<sup>0</sup> is not a [[Maths - Variable|variable]] as its value will always be `1`. Check [[Maths - Terms#^dc0ff7]].

## Property of [[Maths - Terms|Terms]] & Polynomials

### Degree
The **degree** of a [[Maths - Terms|term]] is determined by the power of the [[Maths - Terms#^99b05c|variable part]].

For example, in 5x<sup>4</sup> since the power of the variable is `4` we say the **degree of the term is `4`** or it is a **4<sup>th</sup> degree term**.

**The 0-degree term is usually referred to as the Constant Term.** For example, 6x<sup>0</sup> is a 0-degree term.

When a term has more than one variable, we add up the powers of each variable to get the degree of the term.

For example, 8x<sup>3</sup>y<sup>2</sup> is a 5<sup>th</sup> degree term because `3 + 2 = 5`.

## Why do we care about the degree of terms?

**Polynomials are referred to by the degree of their highest term.**

For example, 7x<sup>4</sup> + 3y<sup>2</sup> is a 4<sup>th</sup> degree polynomial.

Another reason to care about the degree of the terms is that it helps decide the arrangement of a polynomial.

**We arrange the terms in a polynomial from the highest degree â†’ lowest degree.**
