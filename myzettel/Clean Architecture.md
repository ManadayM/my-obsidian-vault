# Clean Architecture
![[Clean Architecture 2022-08-08 15.05.46.excalidraw|100%]]
It is an architecture model that was developed by [[Bob Martin]]. 

## The Four Circles
There are 4 core circles in Clean Architecture.

### Entities
- Primary concepts of your business.
- **Entities have no imports or requires.** Use [[Dependency Injection]] for the dependencies.
- For example, an application for an insurance company might have an entity like a `Claim`. For a product sales application, it would have entities like `Customer`, `Product`, `Order`, etc.

### Use Cases
- Interactions b/w entities.
- For example
	- **Insurance App**: `Filing a claim`.
	- **Sales App**: `Customer places an order`.
	- **Social Media App**: `User posts a tweet`.

### Adapters
To isolate our various use cases from the tools that we use like Frameworks and Drivers from the outermost circle.

### Frameworks & Drivers
All about frameworks and drivers that we use to build our applications like Express.js as Framework, MongoDB driver for Node.js as a driver, etc.

## The Arrows
- You'll notice arrows from the outermost circle to the innermost circle in a uni-direction.
- These **arrows signify the flow of dependency**. An outer circle can depend on the inner circle but **the inner circle cannot depend on the outer circle**.
- This rule is the magic of Clean Architecture. It implies that if the flow of the dependencies goes from **outside â†’ inside** then changes are going to be propagated from **inside â†’ outside**.
- If something changes in a framework or driver. Since there's nothing depending on a framework or driver the changes are isolated to that circle.
- **Most likely to change:** Put them on the outer circles.
- **Most likely to remain the same:** Put them into the innermost circles.

## Inject dependencies, not import
> [!NOTE] Avoid **inside â†’ outside** dependency

Use **[[Dependency Injection]]** to avoid having inverted dependencies i.e. inside layer is dependent on the outside layer.
