# [Maths - Terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffLLmV4mZwU)
- Terms are **Mathematical Expressions** that are made up of two different parts 1) A number part and 2) A variable part. ^99b05c
- The number part and variable part are multiplied together. However, since multiplication is implied in [[Algebra]] the two parts of the Term are written next to each other.
- The number part is also known as the **Coefficient**.
- The variable part can contain one or more variables **raised to a power**. For example, x<sup>2</sup> or just y where y implicitly means y<sup>1</sup>.
- **The term that doesn't have a truly variable part is called a Constant Term.** For example, in 3x<sup>2</sup> + x - 5 the `5` is a constant term. ^dc0ff7
