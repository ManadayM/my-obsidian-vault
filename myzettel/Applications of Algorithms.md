# Applications of Algorithms

The impact of [[Algorithms|Algorithms]] in our lives is broad and far-reaching. They are used everywhere like web searching, packet routing, map navigation & directions, distributed file sharing, movies, video games, e-commerce, recommendations, news feeds, etc.

They solve problems that could not be addressed otherwise. Algorithms are also good for intellectual stimulation. Highly regarded personalities like Linus Torvalds emphasize Data Structure and Algorithms to classify good programmers vs bad programmers.
