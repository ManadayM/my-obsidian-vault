# Graph Database
- A *graph database* is an online database management system with CRUD methods that expose a graph data model.
- Graph databases are generally built for use with transactional ([[OLTP]]) systems.
- A graph database stores nodes and relationships instead of tables, or documents.
- Data is stored without restricting it to a pre-defined model.

## Use cases

- Real-Time Recommendations
- Master Data Management
- Fraud Detection
- Graph Base Search
- Network & IT Operations
- Identity & Access Management

## Drawbacks
Source:: [[The Graph Traversal Pattern.pdf]]
- The primary drawback is that it is difficult to shard a graph. This is also possible with a [[Relational Database]] if it maintains [[Referential Integrity]].
