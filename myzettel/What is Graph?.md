# What is Graph?
A graph is a set of *nodes* and the *relationships* that connect them. It represents entities as *nodes* and the ways in which those entities relate to the world as *relationships*.

Let's represent Twitter's data in a form of a graph.

Each node is labeled User, indicating its role in the network. These nodes are then connected with relationships, which help further establish the semantic context: namely, that Bob follows Shawn, and that Shawn, in turn, follows Bob. Alice and Shaun likewise follow each other, but sadly, although Alice follows Bob, Bob hasnâ€™t (yet) reciprocated.
