## Introduction

- TTFB stands for Time to First Byte. It is the time taken by the browser to receive the first byte of data from the server.
- Time to First Byte is a foundational web performance metric that precedes every other meaningful user experience metrics such as [[FCP]] and [[LCP]].
- High TTFB values add time to the metrics that follow it.
- As a rough guide, most sites should strive to have a TTFB of **0.8 seconds or less**.
