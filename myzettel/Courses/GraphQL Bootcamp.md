## Section 1: Course Overview
[[2022-10-13]]

### What and why GraphQL?
- GraphQL stands for *Graph Query Language*.
- Operates over HTTP.
- GraphQL creates fast and flexible APIs, giving clients complete control to ask for just the data they need.
- Fewer HTTP requests, flexible data querying, and less code to manage.

## Section 2: GraphQL Basics: Schemas and Queries
[[2022-10-13]]
- The term "Graph" in GraphQL refers to all of the application data and how they relate to each other.
- In a blogging app *User*, *Post*, and *Comment* are data types.
- GraphQL Playground - https://graphql-demo.mead.io/
- There are **3 major operations** in GraphQL APIs - **Query**, **Mutation**, and **Subscription**.
- **All GraphQL APIs are self-documenting in contrast to REST APIs.**
- GraphQL is a specification, not an implementation.
- GraphQL Yoga is an implementation for Node.js.
- Install GraphQL Yoga - ```npm install graphql-yoga```.
- 
```

### Query
```graphql
query {
	hello
	courseInstructor
}
```

The above query returns the following result.
```json
{
	"data": {
		"hello": "Hello world",
		"courseInstructor": "Andrew"
	}
}
```
