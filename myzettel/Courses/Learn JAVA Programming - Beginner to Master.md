## Section 1: Introduction
[[2022-09-03]], [[2022-09-04]]
- [[Java Installation]]
- [Java Hello World](https://github.com/ManadayM/Java-Udemy/blob/main/Java101/HelloWorld.java)
- The file name must be the same when the class is marked as `public`.
- Java Provides the `Scanner` class to read data from different sources like keyboards. This class is part of the `java.util.*` package. Check this [ReadKeyboard.java](https://github.com/ManadayM/Java-Udemy/blob/main/Java101/ReadKeyboard.java) example.
- Use `javap` to find what methods are available in a particular class. E.g. `javap java.util.Scanner`.
