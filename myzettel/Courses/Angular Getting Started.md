## Section 4: Components

### Component
An Angular Component is a view defined in a template (HTML with bindings and directives), and its associated code is defined with the class, and metadata is defined with a decorator.

### Creating a new component
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
	selector: 'app-root',
	template: `
		<div>
			<h1>{{pageTitle}}</h1>
			<div>My first component</div>
		</div>
	`
})
export class AppComponent {
	pageTitle: string = 'Acme Product Management';
}
```

> [!INFO] Decorator
> A function that adds **metadata** to a class, its members, or its method arguments. Prefixed with an @ sign. Angular provides built-in decorators like `@Component()`.
