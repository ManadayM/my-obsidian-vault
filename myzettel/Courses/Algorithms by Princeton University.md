## Week 1

#### Section 1 - Introduction
üìö  [[algorithms-part-1_00-intro-slides.pdf|Part 1, Week 1, Section 1 Slides]]
- Started the first week with a course introduction and explored the [[Applications of Algorithms]] in different domains.
- ‚úçÔ∏è [[Java Hello World|Hello World in Java]]

#### Section 2 - Union Find
üìö [[algorithms-part-1_05-union-find-slides.pdf|Part 1, Week 1, Section 2 Slides]]
- Section 2 starts with an introduction to [[Dynamic Connectivity Problem]].
- Implemented [[Quick Find Algorithm]] to make a union between two nodes and then find if there's a connection between two nodes. This algorithm is very expensive for the union operation.
