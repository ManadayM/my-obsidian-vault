# Research without a purpose

At times, we jump on to read in-depth tutorials/articles and watch videos that are irrelevant or less important for our long-term goals. Reading something new or in-trend is good but we should be mindful about our time consumed behind such purposeless activities.

In this regard, [[James Clear]] writes, “Is your reading and research supplementing your actions or substituting for them? Research is useful until it becomes a form of procrastination.”
