## What?

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation. It is a process of optimizing content to be discovered through a search engine's organic search results.

## Why?

- Search traffic is free compared to other mediums like ads and paid marketing.
- Organic traffic is typically consistent once you're ranking high.
- Social Media and email marketing mostly result in traffic spikes.
- Opportunity to reach **massive audiences**.

## How?
1. Crawling and indexation
2. Search Ranking Algorithm

## Google's Ranking Factors
1. **Backlinks** - Links from one website to another.
2. **Search Intent** - The reason behind the searcher's query.
3. **Content Depth** - Depth implies the effectiveness of the answer to the search query. It's not always about the content length. For example, how to restart an iPhone? Won't require too lengthy content to answer that simple question.
