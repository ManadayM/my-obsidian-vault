## What?

Verified emails mean the sender has verified that they own the email address and brand logo. In Gmail, a verified email shows a blue tick beside the sender's name.

Different email service providers may have their own criteria to consider any email address as the verified one. For example, Gmail uses the following to determine that an email is verified.

- BIMI (Brand indicators for message identification)
- VMC (Verified mark certificate)
- DMARC (Domain-based message authentication, reporting, and conformance)

> [!WARNING] Registered Trademark Requirement
> BIMI requires your logo to be a registered trademark. Only such logos are valid to get VMC.
