# Cartesian Products in Maths
> [!TL;DR] 
> A complete set of ordered pairs is called Cartesian Product.

Let's say we have the following two [[Maths - Sets|sets]].

1. **Set T** → a set of teachers → **T = { T<sub>A</sub>, T<sub>B</sub> }**.
2. **Set C** → a set of courses taught by teachers → **C = { English, Spanish, French }**.

Let's write all the possible ways in which every teacher teaches every language.

> [!SUCCESS] Cartesian Product of Set T and Set C
> T X C = { (T<sub>A</sub>, English), (T<sub>A</sub>, Spanish), (T<sub>A</sub>, French), (T<sub>B</sub>, English), (T<sub>B</sub>, Spanish), and (T<sub>B</sub>, French) }

This every possible combination of `(Teacher, Course)` is called **ordered pair**. They are written inside `{}`.

> [!SUCCESS] Cartesian Product of Set T and Set C (Set-Builder Notation)
> T X C = { (t, c): t ∈ T and c ∈ C }

**Here, the relation is a teacher TEACHES a course. Hence, we cannot write (English, T<sub>A</sub>)**.

The Cartesian Product in the above example can be represented as `T X C`.
