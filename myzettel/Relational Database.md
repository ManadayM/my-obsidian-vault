# Relational Database
- Relational databases maintain a collection of tables.
- Each table can be defined by a set of rows and a set of columns.
- Semantically, rows denote objects and columns denote properties/attributes.
- Thus, the datum at a particular row/column-entry is the value of the column property for that row object.
- Usually, a problem domain is modeled over multiple tables in order to avoid data duplication. This process is known as data normalization.
- In order to unify data in disparate tables, a ‚Äújoin‚Äù is used. A join combines two tables when columns of one table refer to columns of another table.
- Maintaining these references in a consistent state is known as [[Referential Integrity]].
