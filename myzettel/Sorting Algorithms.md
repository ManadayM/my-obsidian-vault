# [Sorting Algorithms](https://medium.com/basecs/sorting-out-the-basics-behind-sorting-algorithms-b0a032873add)
- Sorting is a process for organizing a collection or list of **similar items** either in increasing or decreasing order by some property. 
- We sort the collection based on any one property. That property can be really anything - *size*, *lexicographical (alphabetical) order*, *numerical order*, *date*, *time*, etc.
- The dataset must be **homogeneous** in order to sort it. We cannot sort a dataset with both words and numbers, because the dataset doesn't have a shared property through which we can sort our collection.
- The sorted versions of the dataset are called **permutations** or reorderings of original unordered lists.
