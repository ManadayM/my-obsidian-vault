# SEO Keyword Research

## Keywords in SEO

Words or phrases that people type into search engines to find what they're looking for.

## What?

Keyword research is a process to identify the right keywords and phrases to optimize your content for search engines. The eventual goal of the keyword research process is to rank higher on the SERPs (Search Engine Results Page) by identifying the right set of keywords and phrases that has the potential to rank higher in the search result.

## Why?

- To create relevant content by observing trends and searches.
- To understand the competitive landscape. 
- Finding keywords or phrases with low competition. **Focus more on this strategy in a new blog.**
- To get new content ideas.
- **To understand the search intent.** Google's mission is to organize information to make it accessible and useful to everyone consuming it. **Understand the search intent, it will help you to create content that meets the needs of those searching for that keyword.**

## How?

- Make a list of all the topics relevant to your niche. **Topic buckets.**
- Fill the topic buckets with keywords. **Topic bucket keywords**.
- Analyze your keywords based on search intent. **Understand search intent. See if that fits your business.**
- **Capitalize on buying keywords** like "Where to buy...", "best deals for...", "cheap...", "affordable...", and "discounts for...".
- **KGR Method**: The idea was coined by affiliate marketing guru Doug Cunningham. He asserts that someone can rank in the top 10 search results in “less than a month” if you follow his “golden ratio”. “The Keyword Golden Ratio must be less than 0.25. The ratio is…The number of Google results that have the keyword phrase in the title divided by the local monthly search volume, where the LMS is less than 250. If the KGR is less than 0.25, then you should rank in the top 100 when your page is indexed.” Essentially, his idea involves targeting low volume (under 250), low competition keywords in order to rank in the search results super quickly.
