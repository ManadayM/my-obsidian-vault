## What?

- WebAssembly aka "wasm" is a low-level binary format that is designed to be faster and more efficient than traditional JavaScript.
- Allows to run code on the web that is compiled from languages like C, C++, and Rust.
- To compile C/C++ code to WebAssembly, we need a WASM compiler like [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).
