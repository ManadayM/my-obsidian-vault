# Chaos Engineering
> [!NOTE] TL;DR
> Chaos Engineering is the process of testing a distributed computing system to ensure that it can withstand unexpected disruptions.

There are two extreme schools of thought in [[Software Engineering]]. One that thinks once the software is up and running, it will never crash under any circumstances. The other school thinks that software will always break, and downtimes are inevitable.

Chaos Engineering lies somewhere in the middle of the two extremes. It accepts the fact that downtimes happen but with thoughtful and proactive experiments we can increase our confidence in our systems.

The core idea revolves around boosting teams' confidence in the system by identifying loopholes and crash faults in the system through thoughtful experiments.

> [!INFO] Tests vs Experiments
> In Chaos Engineering, we do "experiments" not "tests" due to its exploratory nature.
