# Carbon Footprinting and GHG Emissions 101
Carbon footprint and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are important issues that affect the environment and global climate change. A carbon footprint measures the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere as a result of the activities of a particular individual, organization, or product. GHG emissions, on the other hand, refer to the total amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted into the atmosphere. The larger the carbon footprint and GHG emissions, the greater the impact on the environment and climate change.

Measuring and reducing carbon footprint and GHG emissions is crucial for both individuals and organizations. One of the most widely accepted standards for measuring and reporting carbon footprints and GHG emissions is the "GHG Protocol." Developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the GHG Protocol provides guidelines for measuring and reporting emissions from both corporate and product activities.

## Corporate Carbon Footprinting
Corporate Carbon Footprinting refers to the measurement and reporting of the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with the operations of a company or organization. This includes emissions from activities such as electricity and heat generation, transportation, and waste management. Corporate carbon footprinting allows companies to identify the main sources of their emissions and to set targets for reducing their carbon footprint over time.

Measuring a corporate carbon footprint involves identifying the sources of emissions associated with a company's operations, collecting data on those sources, and calculating the emissions using the appropriate methods as specified by the GHG Protocol. Once the emissions have been calculated, the company can then report them to the relevant government bodies or other reporting platforms, such as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).

Many examples of companies have successfully reduced their carbon footprint through corporate carbon footprinting. For instance, a retail company may identify that a significant portion of its emissions come from its fleet of delivery trucks. By implementing more fuel-efficient vehicles and implementing a telematics system to optimize routes, the company was able to reduce its emissions significantly. Another example is a building company that has been able to reduce emissions by implementing energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems and using renewable energy sources.

Corporate carbon footprinting is an important step for companies to take to understand their emissions and to take actions to reduce their environmental impact. By setting reduction targets, companies can establish a plan of action to decrease their carbon footprint and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.

## Product Carbon Footprinting
Product Carbon Footprinting refers to the measurement and reporting of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, use, and disposal of a specific product. It involves assessing the entire lifecycle of a product, including the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, use, and end-of-life disposal. Product carbon footprinting allows companies to identify the specific products and processes that have the greatest environmental impact and to take steps to reduce their carbon footprint.

Measuring a product's carbon footprint requires an understanding of the entire product life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials, through the manufacturing process, distribution, usage, and disposal of the product. By evaluating the emissions generated at each stage of the life cycle, a company can identify the areas where emissions are the highest, and focus on those areas to reduce the carbon footprint.

For example, a fashion company may discover that a significant portion of the emissions associated with a particular product comes from the dyeing and finishing process. By changing to a more sustainable dyeing method, the company was able to reduce the carbon footprint of that product.
