# Scopes in Greenhouse Gas Protocol

## The concept of "scope"

To help delineate direct and indirect emission sources, improve transparency, and provide utility for different types of organizations and different types of climate policies and business goals, three "scopes" (scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3) are defined for GHG accounting and reporting purposes.

### Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions
- Direct GHG emissions occur from sources that are owned or controlled by the company.
- Direct CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the combustion of biomass shall not be included in the scope 1 but reported separately.
- GHG emissions not covered by the Kyoto Protocol, e.g. CFCs, NOx, etc. shall not be included in scope 1 but may be reported separately.

### Scope 2: Electricity indirect GHG emissions
- Scope 2 accounts for GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the company.

### Scope 3: Other indirect GHG emissions
- Scope 3 is an **optional reporting category** for the treatment of all other indirect emissions.
- Scope 3 emissions are a **consequence of the activities of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company**.
- Examples: extraction and production of purchased materials, waste generation, empolyee commuting, business travel, transportation of purchased fuels, and use of sold products and services.
- Scope 3 emissions can be divided into two categories - **Upstream Emissions**, **Downstream Emissions**.

These scopes (1, 2, and 3) allow us to identify emissions which have our **highest influence**. These categorisation also allows us to identify the **emission hotspots**.
