# Carbon Footprint and GHG 101

## Carbon Footprint
A carbon footprint is a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are released into the atmosphere as a result of the activities of a particular individual, organization, or product. In simple terms, it is the total amount of carbon emissions that are produced by an individual, company, or organization, over a specific period of time. The larger the carbon footprint, the greater the impact on the environment and on climate change.

## GHG Protocol
GHG Protocol is a carbon footprint measurement standard that is most widely accepted globally. GHG stands for greenhouse gases, which are the gases that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, causing global warming. The GHG Protocol is a set of guidelines for measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions. It was developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and is considered to be the most widely used standard for measuring and reporting carbon footprints. The GHG Protocol includes guidelines for both corporate and product carbon footprinting, and it is used by companies, governments, and other organizations around the world to measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions.

## Emission Factor
An emission factor (EF) is a coefficient that describes the rate at which a given activity releases greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. They are also referred to as _conversion factors, emission intensity_ and _carbon intensity_.

## How Global Warming is Measured
The most well-known greenhouse gas is CO2. It is not the only one however - methane and nitrous oxide are two other major warming gases in a long list of GHGs. Measuring the comparative impact of these is complicated by the fact that **the different gases vary both in how much they warm the atmosphere and how long they remain in the atmosphere**.

For example, nitrous oxide (N2O) has a "100-year" warming effect 265-298 times more than CO2. This relative index is called Global Warming Potential (GWP), which expresses how much warming a gas will provide over some time frame. These are typically in 20-, 100- or 500-year terms; the world uses 100-year GWP numbers to assess the climate emergency as this is the time frame it is typically described over.

For that reason, GHG emissions are often measured in CO2e (CO2 equivalents) expressed in weight, normally kg (kilograms) or t (tonne/metric ton). This unit expresses the 100-year warming effect of a given amount of a GHG in comparison to that of CO2. In other words, **for a given amount of any GHG, CO2e expresses the amount of CO2 that would warm the atmosphere as much as the same amount of the gas in question, over a 100-year time frame from the moment of release**.

## Corporate vs Product Carbon Footprinting
Corporate carbon footprinting refers to the measurement and reporting of the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with the operations of a company or organization. This includes emissions from activities such as electricity and heat generation, transportation, and waste management. Corporate carbon footprinting is often used by companies and organizations to identify the main sources of their emissions and to set targets for reducing their carbon footprint over time.

Measuring a corporate carbon footprint involves identifying the sources of emissions associated with a company's operations, collecting data on those sources, and calculating the emissions using the appropriate methods as specified by the GHG Protocol. Once the emissions have been calculated, the company can then report them to the relevant government bodies or other reporting platforms, such as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).

There are many examples of companies that have successfully reduced their carbon footprint through corporate carbon footprinting. For instance, a retail company may identify that a significant portion of their emissions come from their fleet of delivery trucks. By implementing more fuel-efficient vehicles and implementing a telematics system to optimize routes, the company was able to reduce their emissions significantly. Another example is a building company that has been able to reduce emissions by implementing energy-efficient lighting, HVAC systems, and using renewable energy sources.

Corporate carbon footprinting is an important step for companies to take in order to understand their emissions and to take actions to reduce their environmental impact. By setting reduction targets, companies can establish a plan of action to decrease their carbon footprint and to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.

Product Carbon Footprinting refers to the measurement and reporting of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, use, and disposal of a specific product. It involves assessing the entire lifecycle of a product, including the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, use, and end-of-life disposal. Product carbon footprinting allows companies to identify the specific products and processes that have the greatest environmental impact and to take steps to reduce their carbon footprint.

Measuring a product's carbon footprint requires an understanding of the entire product life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials, through the manufacturing process, distribution, usage, and disposal of the product. By evaluating the emissions generated at each stage of the life cycle, a company can identify the areas where emissions are the highest, and focus on those areas to reduce the carbon footprint.

For example, a fashion company may discover that a significant portion of the emissions associated with a particular product comes from the dyeing and finishing process. By changing to a more sustainable dyeing method, the company was able to reduce the carbon footprint of that product.

So while corporate carbon footprinting assesses the entire company, product carbon footprinting specifically assesses the environmental impact of a product during its life cycle.

## Scopes in GHG Protocol
The GHG Protocol includes three scopes that can be used to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions:

1. **Scope 1 emissions:** These are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by an organization, such as emissions from on-site combustion of fossil fuels or emissions from company-owned vehicles. For example, the emissions produced by burning coal to generate electricity at a power plant would be considered Scope 1 emissions.
    
2. **Scope 2 emissions:** These are emissions associated with the generation of electricity, heat, or steam that an organization consumes but does not own or control. For example, the emissions produced by a power plant that is supplying electricity to an organization would be considered Scope 2 emissions.
    
3. **Scope 3 emissions:** These are emissions that are a result of the activities of an organization, but that occur from sources not owned or controlled by the organization. For example, the emissions from the production of raw materials that are used to manufacture a product would be considered Scope 3 emissions. The emissions produced by employees commuting to work would be another example of Scope 3 emissions.

These scopes allow for a comprehensive view of the organization's emission, starting from its internal source to external activities related to the company. It allows organizations to identify the main sources of their emissions, set reduction targets, and make more informed decisions in reducing their carbon footprint.

## Grid Region in GHG Calculation
In GHG Protocol, the grid region is a concept used to calculate and report the emissions associated with the consumption of electricity. The grid region is the geographical area where electricity is generated and consumed.

When calculating emissions from electricity consumption (Scope 2 emissions), it is important to consider the grid region in order to accurately estimate the emissions associated with the electricity consumed. This is because the emissions factors (i.e. the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of electricity) can vary significantly depending on the source of the electricity. For example, electricity generated from coal will have a higher emissions factor than electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind or solar.

When reporting emissions, organizations can use the grid region information to indicate the source of the electricity consumed and the associated emissions factor. This allows organizations to understand their emissions intensity and to compare their performance to other organizations. Additionally, it allows organizations to identify opportunities to reduce their emissions by sourcing electricity from low-carbon sources.

It's important to note that in some cases, the grid region may not be clearly defined, or the grid may be interconnected, in those cases, organizations will have to use the best available data or default values provided by the GHG protocol in order to estimate the emissions.

## GWP Dataset - AR4 vs AR5
R4 and AR5 refer to the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC is a scientific body established by the United Nations (UN) to provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments of the state of knowledge on climate change.

The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) was published in 2007 and provided a comprehensive evaluation of the science of climate change. It included three working group reports on the physical science of climate change, impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptation, as well as a synthesis report that integrated the findings of the working groups. AR4 was considered a major milestone in the understanding of climate change, providing clear evidence of human influence on the climate system and highlighting the potential impacts of climate change on natural and human systems.

The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) was published between 2013 and 2014, it built on the findings of the AR4 and provide an updated and more detailed assessment of the state of knowledge on climate change. It included a summary for policy-makers, three working group reports on the physical science of climate change, impacts, and vulnerabilities, and adaptation and a synthesis report. AR5 reinforced the findings of AR4 and further strengthened the evidence of human influence on the climate system and the impacts of

climate change, particularly on the most vulnerable regions of the world. Additionally, it provided a more detailed picture of the future impacts of climate change and the potential risks and opportunities associated with different levels of warming.

Overall, both AR4 and AR5 are considered important resources for policymakers, scientists, and the general public, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the state of knowledge on climate change, the impacts, and the mitigation and adaptation options available.

It's important to note that, you should use the most recent version of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard to ensure compliance with the standard and to ensure that your carbon footprint calculation is accurate, transparent, and consistent with others. Additionally, it's always good to check with the relevant regulatory bodies or guidelines in your country, region, or industry to ensure compliance with any mandatory reporting requirements.
