# Feynman Technique

![](https://149664534.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FeynmanTechnique-min.jpg)

- The Feynman Learning Technique is a simple way of approaching anything new you want to learn.
- Information is learned when you can explain it and use it in a wide variety of situations.

There are four steps to the Feynman Learning Technique.

**Step 1: Pretend to teach it to a child or a rubber duck**
- Software engineers sometimes tackle debugging by explaining their code, line by line, to a **rubber duck**.
- we mask our lack of understanding by using complicated vocabulary and jargon
- You need to make sure your explanation isn’t above, say, a sixth-grade reading level by using easily accessible words and phrases.

**Step 2: Identify gaps in your explanation**
- Keep going until you can explain everything you need to in basic terms.
- Only when you can explain your understanding without jargon and in simple terms can you demonstrate your understanding.

**Step 3. Organize and simplify**
- Now you have a set of hand-crafted notes containing a simple explanation. Organize them into a narrative that you can tell from beginning to end.

**Step 4: Transmit (optional)**
- Attempt to transmit the material to at least one person who isn’t that familiar with it.
