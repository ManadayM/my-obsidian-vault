# [Builder Design Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ff_KZdvJn8)
- It is a [[Creational Design Pattern]] that lets you construct complex objects **step by step**.
- This pattern can be useful in a scenario where any classes have a set of complex constructors.
- This pattern helps classes and objects which require **immutability**.

## Wardrobe Analogy
To build a mirror we need to consider the following points.
- Wardrobes can be of multiple types - one door, two or more doors, shelves, mirrors, hanging rods, materials, etc.
- There are certain essential features while building a wardrobe like one or more doors, materials, and the number of compartments.
- And, there are other optional features that can be considered based on the requirements like mirrors, wheels, hanging rods, etc.
