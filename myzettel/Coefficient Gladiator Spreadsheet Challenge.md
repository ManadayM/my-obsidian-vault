## Terminology ü§î

#### Opportunity Name
A label you can give a sales deal that at a glance tells you who and what you are selling in views and reports.

#### Forecast Category üî•
The Forecast Category field in Salesforce classifies each sales opportunity in terms of the <font color="darkgreen">salesperson‚Äôs confidence in winning the deal in a given period</font>.

##### Pipeline (25%)
Pipeline means the customer is in the early stages of the buying process, and deals in this Forecast Category need developing further. As a guide, you should expect only a quarter of these deals to close within the quarter.

##### Best Case (35%)
Best Case means there is work to do to advance these opportunities. You should expect to win between a third and half of the deals in the Best Case category.

##### Commit (90%)
You should expect to win 90% of the opportunities in this Forecast Category.

##### Closed (100%)
Include all of the opportunities in Closed in the sales forecast for the month or quarter.
