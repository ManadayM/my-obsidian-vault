# Before starting the AWS learning journey
AWS doesn't support any hard budget limit so if you forget or inadvertently leave some services running then you will incur undesirable bill. This can happen even when you're using [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) plan.

There are many surprise AWS bill horror stories out there on the Internet like [this](https://twitter.com/flaviocopes/status/1542148015808544769) and [this](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1541892714094100481). Following are some links worth keeping handy if you're new to AWS.
