# Pure Function

A pure function is idempotent, it returns the same result for the same input and does not have any side effects.

There are two most important rules to remember.
1. It does not change any state that is visible outside.
2. It does not depend on anything outside that may possibly change.

- Functional programming relies on lazy evaluation for efficiency.
- Lazy evaluation and parallel execution rely on immutability and purity of functions for correctness. 
- **Immutability and purity are essentials for FP's survival, it's not fashion.**
